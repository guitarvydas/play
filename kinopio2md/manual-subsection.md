## Subsection Title: The Nature of Control Flow and Data

In the context of computer systems, it is essential to understand the fundamental distinction between control flow and data. 

Control flow represents the dynamic interpretation of data, while data is inherently static and remains uninterpreted by the underlying system.

Control flow can be likened to the interpretive process carried out by a central processing unit (CPU). The CPU acts as an interpreter, translating high-level instructions into low-level operations known as opcodes. It does so swiftly and efficiently, often blurring the line between interpretation and execution. This interpretation of opcodes is so rapid that we often perceive it as something other than mere interpretation.

In contrast, data is static in nature and remains unaltered by the underlying system. It is the program, rather than the CPU, that interprets and manipulates data. This clear distinction between the dynamic nature of control flow and the static character of data is fundamental to understanding the functioning of computer systems.

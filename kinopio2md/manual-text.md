control flow is not data
- control flow is _interpretation_ of data - dynamic flow
  - a CPU is an interpreter
	- a CPU interprets _opcodes_
		- a CPU interprets _opcodes_ so quickly that we think of it as something other than interpretation
- data is _static_ - and is not interpreted by the underlying system
  - static data is interpreted by the _program_, not the CPU

rust (tbd)

1. The focus should be on communicating ideas rather than just writing. Writing is a means to an end.

2. Brainstorming and engineering are different. Brainstorming requires tools with low friction to allow for iteration and discovery.

# Cole's Notes / Summary

3. Many programming languages require too much upfront detail, which hinders the design process.

4. Tools like Kinopio and Scapple allow for frictionless thinking and brainstorming. They allow ideas to be captured quickly and then edited later.

5. Rust was discussed as a programming language. Cole finds that Rust encourages a maintainable coding style for teams.

6. Descript was mentioned as a tool for editing transcripts and screencasts. Paul uses it to edit down raw transcripts into something more presentable.

7. Fermat was briefly discussed as a tool that allows for an iterative design process by being a simple programmable whiteboard.

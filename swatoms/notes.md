Ultimate goal: brainstorm in Kinopio, convert to chapters for a book (or essays for a blog)

advice appreciated - I'm reading up on Khoj, but, would like any help for reducing my learning curve ; I don't mind writing code if necessary but I don't want to reinvent the wheel or do unnecessary coding and thinking and learning, if possible

- background:
  - Kinopio arranges ideas as small snippets called "cards"
  - "cards" can be be joined by (directional) connections called "connections"
  - all of this info can be exported by Kinopio in JSON format
  - most of the JSON is related to display information (e.g. graphical paths), the semantic information is there, but tangled up with display information (e.g. semantic info is: card-id, card-text, connection start and end, connection types) [I've use PROLOG to do such culling in the past, but, I wonder if A.I. can do it for me with less bother]
  - I would like A.I. to cull the JSON, leaving only the semantic info
  - I would like A.I. to treat the connections as markdown sub-headings (or something like that)
  - I would like A.I. to wrap prose around the points to create chapters / essays out of the point-form brainstorming
  - a (simplified) sample Kinopio page ("space") is: https://kinopio.club/sw-atoms-XidvtBMoiFFoAGym3XYx4
  - the JSON output of this page is:

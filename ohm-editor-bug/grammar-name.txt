issue: grammar name of pre-existing test example does not track grammar name changes

how:
1) create a working grammar and test case - in this example, I created a grammar called CSS
2) change the name of the grammar - in this case, I changed it to newCSS

result: the previously-working test case now fails ; the previously-working test case still refers to a "Start rule:" of the previous grammar (CSS) and not the new grammar (newCSS).

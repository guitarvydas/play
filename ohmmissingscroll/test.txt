// Data for an asyncronous component - effectively, a function with input
// and output queues of messages.
//
// Components can either be a user-supplied function ("leaf"), or a "container"
// that routes messages to child components according to a list of connections
// that serve as a message routing table.
//
// Child components themselves can be leaves or other containers.
//
// `handler` invokes the code that is attached to this component. For leaves, it
// is a wrapper function around `leaf_handler` that will perform a type check
// before calling the user's function. For containers, `handler` is a reference
// to `container_handler`, which will dispatch messages to its children.
//
// `leaf_data` is a pointer to any extra state data that the `leaf_handler`
// function may want whenever it is invoked again.
//
// `state` is a free integer that can be used for writing leaves that act as
// state machines. There is a convenience proc `set_state` that will do the
// cast for you when writing.

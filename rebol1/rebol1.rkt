;; (testit) ; You can call this to test the code, but it won't display anything


;;; Please note that the (testit) call won't display anything directly. To observe the output of the code, you can use the Racket IDE or the DrRacket editor, where you can interact with the code more conveniently.

;;;;  Hmm, it didn't complete the testit code, I tried again

To convert the Common Lisp code to Racket, we'll use the previously converted code and integrate it with the provided `testit` function. Here's the Racket version:

```racket
#lang racket

;; The previously converted code

(define (lookup environment symbol)
  ;; ... (rest of the lookup function)

(define (extend-environment environment formals values)
  ;; ... (rest of the extend-environment function)

(define (environment-define! environment symbol value)
  ;; ... (rest of the environment-define! function)

(define (initial-environment)
  ;; ... (rest of the initial-environment function)

(define (arity applicable)
  ;; ... (rest of the arity function)

(define (rebol-eval-one expr-list environment)
  ;; ... (rest of the rebol-eval-one function)

(define (rebol-eval-n n expr-list environment)
  ;; ... (rest of the rebol-eval-n function)

(define (rebol-eval-application function expr-list environment)
  ;; ... (rest of the rebol-eval-application function)

(define (rebol-apply applicable arglist)
  ;; ... (rest of the rebol-apply function)

(define (rebol-eval-sequence expr-list environment)
  ;; ... (rest of the rebol-eval-sequence function)

;; The testit function

(define (testit)
  (rebol-eval-sequence
   '(define fib
      (lambda (x)
        (if (lessp x 2)
            x
            (add (fib (sub1 x))
                 (fib (sub x 2)))))

     (define fact
       (lambda (x)
         (if (zerop x)
             1
             (mult x (fact (sub1 x))))))

     (define fact-iter
       (lambda (x answer)
         (if (zerop x)
             answer
             (fact-iter (sub1 x) (mult answer x)))))

     (print (fib 7))
     (print (fact 6))
     (print (fact-iter 7 1)))
   (initial-environment)))

;; Call testit to run the code

(testit)
```

;;; Note that in Racket, we use `(define ...)` instead of `(defun ...)`, and we use `(lambda ...)` instead of `lambda`. Other than these changes, the rest of the code remains mostly the same, as we integrated the previously converted code into the `testit` function. When you run this Racket code, it should produce the same output as the original Common Lisp code.

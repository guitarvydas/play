"hello" -> print $1

// value -> command(incoming value)    
// for now value is always a string
// for now incoming value is always the id '<1'
// for now, send always goes to /dev/fd/5
// for now, receive always comes from /dev/fd/6
// for now, /dev/fd/3 and /dev/fd/4 are reserved for kernel usage
// for now, we ignore /dev/fd/0, /dev/fd/1 and /dev/fd/2

// the above program generates 1 shell script and uses 1 bash commands (echo) twice
hello -> display

s there already a way to do this?: I think that I want a Stack (lifo) of information.  When I "add" something to the stack, it becomes the "first thing" that I see when I go to that space.

background: For example, I have a huge, flat pile of cards in my "Check Out" space.  Today, I added another ca

Today, I added another card, but had to scroll all the way to the bottom.  For a moment, I thought that I wanted to add the new card at the top and shift everything down, but, then, I thought that what I really want is to add a card to the space and to move everything already there to a sub-space, i

move all cards to new space, create a card with a reference to the new space].  I would probably use this for my TODO list, too, if I had it...  I think that all of the bits and pieces to do this manually are already in Kinopio, but the only way I can think to use them will create too much "friction

"friction" and break my "flow". 


i.e. clicking on "Check Out" will show me the new card and a "/" card to the rest of the stuff that was there yesterday.  Ad infinitum. Kinda like "push()" in Lisp.  Or, do I want keyboard-macros?  Create my own push: [select all, create new space (with a date in its name), move all cards to new spa
